# CUSTOM MSGS PACKAGE

This package contains the definition of a set of custom ROS2 srvs (CheckEvenOdd.srv) and action (Fibonacci.action) messages. 

## REMINDER

Remember to source the workspace in every terminal you want to use these messages

```
source install/setup.bash
```

Alternatively, you can add this line to your .bashrc file
